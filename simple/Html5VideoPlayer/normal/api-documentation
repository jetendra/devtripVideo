This player component need to be instantiated as follows - 

var _devtripVideo = new devtripVideo();

With normal devtrip video component following methods are available, these parameters are mandatory not optional -

1. To associate player with a container use 
    params.containerId = "playercontainer1";
2. To set width of the player use
    params.width = "320";
3. To set height of the player use
    params.height = "240";
4. To set assets path use 
    _devtripVideo.setPath("assets/"); 
    default path is "".
5. To disable auto play use  
    params.autoplay = false;
6. Player will auto detect the extension required for a browser so it is recommended to have [.mp4,.webm, .ogg] format of video file with server.
   params.video = "abc";
   .mp4,.webm, .ogg format should be available at asset path.
7. Poster image can be provided using 
    params.videoImage = "abc.png";
    Image should be available at asset path.

	  _devtripVideo.init(params);

    _devtripVideo.dispose();
