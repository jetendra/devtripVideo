devtripVideo player component need to be instantiated as follows - 

var _devtripVideo = new devtripVideo();

With normal devtrip video component following methods are available,these parameters are mandatory not optional -

1. call init(param) to initialise player and its object and their associated listeners.
	_devtripVideo.init(params);

	1.1. To associate player with a container use 
		params.containerId = "playercontainer1";
		
	1.2. To set width of the player use
		params.width = "320";
		
	1.3. To set height of the player use
		params.height = "240";
		
	1.4. To disable auto play use  
		params.autoplay = false;
		
	1.5. Player will auto detect the extension required for a browser so it is recommended to have [.mp4,.webm, .ogg] format of video file with server.
	   params.video = "abc";
	   .mp4,.webm, .ogg format should be available at asset path.
	   
	1.6. Poster image can be provided using 
		params.videoImage = "abc.png";
		Image should be available at asset path.
	
2. To set assets path use 
    _devtripVideo.setPath("assets/"); 
    default path is "".
	  
3. call dispose() to remove internal listener of player.
    _devtripVideo.dispose();
